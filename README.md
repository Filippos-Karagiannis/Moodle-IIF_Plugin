# Moodle-IIF_Plugin
Plugin for Moodle courses to Incorporate Curriculum material using the IIIF framework. Works exclusively with Semantics' environment.

Search functionality from https://visuallibrary.net has been integrated so the user can Import easier.

Javascript changes are made in the amd folder, minification is necessary for the code to be up to date(personally i used Grunt).

Some functions may be broken due to Json-format/Variable changes provided from the server.

The whole foldern needs to be placed inside: Moodle/mod and is visible when creating/editing modules in a class
